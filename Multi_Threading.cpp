/* Multithreading is a specialized form of multitasking 
multitasking is the feature that allows your computer to run two or more programs concurrently
In general, there are two types of multitasking: process-based and thread-based.

1)Process-based multitasking handles the concurrent execution of programs. Thread-based multitasking deals with the concurrent execution of pieces of the same program.
2)Multithreaded program contains two or more parts that can run concurrently. Each part of such a program is called a thread, and each thread defines a separate path of execution.
